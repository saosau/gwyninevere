<p>I&rsquo;m kidding, but things got the hang of me. Either people don&rsquo;t have
enough time to listen, or it doesn&rsquo;t get through to anyone. So I create
this space where I can become mellow at least to myself. Sometimes this
feeling eats me, so I tell myself I&rsquo;ll work, but I finally lose to it,
so I feel like this is the safest way for me to express myself.</p>
<p>When we (our generation) call ourselves hard stuck plat, it just really
means we are in a slump. To get to platinum you need to get the hang of
the game pretty well. Then there comes the grind through diamond to
masters until you reach challenger and get a backpack. I stopped playing
games far ago, but sometimes it feels like being hardstuck (plat).</p>
<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;ve been sitting in front of the computer for far too long.
All of my posts are on Computer Science section so it really is
depressing in a way (just kidding). So I&rsquo;ve been pushing myself to
end all the projects early, and here I am, finally free. Honestly I got
a bit sick of screens, so in a way I like the fact that when we learn
theory, we code on paper.</p>
<p>I may not seem like it, but I obviously love the subject, I mean who
doesn&rsquo;t, anyone uses technology subconsciously. (Personally, I think
giving kids &ldquo;smart&rdquo; phones is a really bad idea.) But god, please,
how can you talk about your favourite algorithm for the whole day?
And have literally no other things you could talk about.
Maybe I&rsquo;m too stupid or dull to understand how people can just study
their whole life. Well, at least I know I am not the <em>best</em> student.
And I&rsquo;ll never be, but I do admire and respect the <em>best</em>.</p>
<p>So my friend recommended me this TV show for me to lash out on called
&ldquo;Bocchi the Rock!&rdquo;. It was pretty interesting. One thing that
got into my mind was when the protagonist said she was lonely so she
played 6 hours every day. I thought, well I can&rsquo;t say that, maybe that&rsquo;s
the problem.</p>
<p>So the songs are really, pretty decent.
