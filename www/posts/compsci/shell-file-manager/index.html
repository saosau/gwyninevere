        <p>I put a lot of time nurturing this shell script. As a result it comes
with many functionalities, but I consider them all essential.</p>
<p>If all of this is complicated, why not write it in C? Well, when I
started out, I didn&rsquo;t really know that much of low-level programming.
I will defend with an argument, that despite shell being slow, all this
script does is calling other programs, so it&rsquo;s execution depends on the
utils. But what if GNU coreutils are bloated?</p>
<p>[ The video, it&rsquo;s not here yet&hellip; ? SAO! ]</p>

<h2 id="assumptions" class="anchor-link"><a href="#assumptions">Assumptions<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start of with the fact, that fzf is an imperfect program. Simply
run these two lines&hellip;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#8a8a8a;background-color:#1c1c1c;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>touch <span style="color:#00afaf">$&#39;fun\ndestroyer&#39;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>fzf 
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So obviously, the product will be imperfect as well. Our application
works, but isn&rsquo;t a professionally written one, it would have to be
rewritten from the core. And I know, you can delimit files with <code>\0</code>
instead, but it&rsquo;s flawed anyway. But I think it&rsquo;s fine this way, fzf
is an amazing add-on to the shell and we are here to make it even more
amazing.</p>

<h2 id="improvement-1" class="anchor-link"><a href="#improvement-1">Improvement #1<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>Instead of cd&rsquo;ing into a deep directory you can select the directory on
fzf query through list of directories. Add these to your shell rc:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#8a8a8a;background-color:#1c1c1c;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>st-hcd() { <span style="color:#0087ff">prev</span>=<span style="color:#5f8700">$(</span><span style="color:#0087ff">pwd</span><span style="color:#5f8700">)</span> <span style="color:#0087ff">dir</span>=<span style="color:#5f8700">$(</span>fzfcmd -H<span style="color:#5f8700">)</span>; [[ <span style="color:#0087ff">$dir</span> ]] &amp;&amp; <span style="color:#0087ff">cd</span> <span style="color:#00afaf">&#34;</span><span style="color:#0087ff">$dir</span><span style="color:#00afaf">&#34;</span> &amp;&amp; ls; }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>st-cd() { <span style="color:#0087ff">prev</span>=<span style="color:#5f8700">$(</span><span style="color:#0087ff">pwd</span><span style="color:#5f8700">)</span> <span style="color:#0087ff">dir</span>=<span style="color:#5f8700">$(</span>fzfcmd -d<span style="color:#5f8700">)</span>; [[ <span style="color:#0087ff">$dir</span> ]] &amp;&amp; <span style="color:#0087ff">cd</span> <span style="color:#00afaf">&#34;</span><span style="color:#0087ff">$dir</span><span style="color:#00afaf">&#34;</span> &amp;&amp; ls; }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>st-bcd() { [[ <span style="color:#5f8700">$(</span><span style="color:#0087ff">pwd</span><span style="color:#5f8700">)</span> = <span style="color:#0087ff">$HOME</span> ]] || <span style="color:#0087ff">cd</span> ..; }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>st-dcd() { <span style="color:#0087ff">cd</span> <span style="color:#00afaf">&#34;</span><span style="color:#0087ff">$prev</span><span style="color:#00afaf">&#34;</span>; }
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then you can set keybindings in your shell rc or your terminal settings
to call for these functions.</p>

<h2 id="improvement-2" class="anchor-link"><a href="#improvement-2">Improvement #2<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>Sometimes we move/copy/remove multiple files from a directory that is
deeper then the current working one and writing out that same path can
feel repetetive. As a remedy we usually cd into that folder, but then
to move/copy it to the directory from a different branch we need to
find it by instinctively typing in <code>../../..</code> .</p>
<p>Instead, we can stay in the common directory, first query source files,
then query destination directory. Since operations can differ, <code>fzfcmd -x</code>
does 3 queries, additional one for selecting the bulk command.</p>
<p>fzfcmd enables multiple selection on file queries. If you want certain
group of files to be included, write a pattern that will list only the
files you want and press BTab (Shift + Tab) which toggles them all. You
can also toggle/untoggle single files with Tab.</p>

<h2 id="improvement-3" class="anchor-link"><a href="#improvement-3">Improvement #3<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>Sometimes we want to rename files in bulk, and vim is a perfect tool for
regex find and replace, appending, prepending or enumerating files. As in
<strong>#2</strong>, we query source files. Then these files are printed in a
lexicographical order and opened in vim. Make the changes you need, then
save and quit. Once out, fzfcmd renames files using names in the
corresponding lines. You can call this utility like this: <code>fzfcmd -r</code> .</p>

<h2 id="caveat" class="anchor-link"><a href="#caveat">Caveat<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>At this rate, this app can do as much, and maybe much more than other
file managers. There must be a caveat behind going deep in the file
structures and there actually is one. Sometimes we want to work on files
that are on the certain depth, but fzfcmd will always recurse into the
rest. To fix this, we can tailor queries, fzfcmd has 5 types: <em>default,
sorted, depth 1, depth 2, depth 3 query</em>. To use them press either of
these 5 keys &ldquo;~`@#%&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="sugar-syntax" class="anchor-link"><a href="#sugar-syntax">Sugar syntax<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>And this, THIS is what fzf is for. Oh my god, the file previewing option
is golden. With <code>ueberzug</code> and <code>ffmpegthumbnailer</code> <em>most</em> of the files
will get their preview. Directories are listed with <em>ls</em>, text files with
<em>cat</em>, pictures are displayed with <em>ueberzug</em>. Since videos and pdf files
don&rsquo;t have their picture representation we create their thumbnails and
cache them.</p>

<h2 id="app-picker" class="anchor-link"><a href="#app-picker">App-picker<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>This goes with <strong>#2</strong>, but we can bulk execute files as well. Different
files are ran differently, but really, it is a simple switch case. But
sometimes we don&rsquo;t want all of them to be opened at once, for example
songs. We want them enqueued. With <em>mpv</em>, app-picker communicates with
its socket to enqueue selected songs. So during listen or even after,
app-picker checks if mpv is running, and if it is, appends songs.
Terminal terminal!</p>

</div>

<p>All of this makes life in the terminal so much easier, and we all love
terminals.</p>
