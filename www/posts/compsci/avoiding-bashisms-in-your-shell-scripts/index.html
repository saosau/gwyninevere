        <p>When we say bashism, it does not neccessarily mean it came from Bash. I
refer it to as such, because majority have Bash as their default
interpreters. So, in a way, it is kind of an oversimplification from me.
And as such, this post is more Bash-centric.

<p>POSIX is a set of standards specified by IEEE. It is all about
compatibility and portability. When we say Bash is POSIX compliant, it
means that Bash can read with no problem a POSIX compliant script. When
we say a shell script is POSIX compliant, it means it complies to the
POSIX standard.</p>

<h2 id="list-of-bashisms-and-how-it-is-done-in-posix" class="anchor-link"><a href="#list-of-bashisms-and-how-it-is-done-in-posix">List of bashisms and how it is done in POSIX<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Tests</li>
</ul>
<p>Test is a command that is equivalent to [expression] in shell scripts.
You may see [[expression]] version which is undefined in POSIX. This
&ldquo;test on steroids&rdquo; has much more functionality like regex etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrays</li>
</ul>
<p>Arrays are undefined, so <code>declare -A</code> or <code>arr=(var1 var2)</code> are bashisms.
As for how to mimic this functionality, you would want to use <code>set</code> .
For example <code>arr=(var1 var2)</code> is equivalent to <code>set -- var1 var2</code> .
Then you can get values with indices, <code>$1</code> <code>$2</code> .</p>
<ul>
<li>Parameter expansions</li>
</ul>
<p>This happens, when you want for example, for a parameter to change
value in case it is unset or null. Bash adds on lots more features.</p>
<p>As for little things:</p>
<ul>
<li>exporting functions is undefined;</li>
<li>no process substitutions; &lt;(command)</li>
<li>no herestrings; &lt;&lt;&lt;(variable)</li>
<li>$&rsquo;\n&rsquo; does not work at all;</li>
<li>no local parameters in functions;</li>
<li>a lot of echo parameters are undefined.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just avoid these. You could use <code>checkbashisms</code> and <code>shellcheck</code> that
niftly scan your code for improvements, and above all you should
check out this beautiful manual
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/">here</a>.
The things I have mentioned above of course are not everything, but
they are the most common things you will encounter on public forums like
– ekhm – stackoverflow.</p>
