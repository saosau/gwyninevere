<p>One day while browsing linux content, I found articles on RSS feeds.
At first it felt very counterintuitive. Subscribe to a Youtube channel -
get Youtube feed. Follow someone on Twitter - get Twitter feed. So logical
and so right. It would never come to my mind, that something like RSS
could exist.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works-so-harmonically" class="anchor-link"><a href="#how-it-works-so-harmonically">How it works so harmonically<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>As an example, check out my <a href="/rss.xml">RSS feed</a>. It has listings of
max 15 (could be whatever) last posts, each with a header and description.
Now, when I post a new article, a new entry will appear in the XML file.
Your RSS application pulls that link again and notifies you about a new
entry. See a pattern? Creator posts a video, XML file updates, you get
notified. Creator posts a social media status, XML file updates&hellip; you
get the drill.</p>

<h2 id="adding-urls-to-newsboat" class="anchor-link"><a href="#adding-urls-to-newsboat">Adding urls to newsboat<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>First thing that greets us in the beginning is error output asking us to
create the RSS feed. Do so, then press <code>R</code> to reload.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># $HOME/.newsboat/urls

<p>That is all and nice, but we cannot open any links, because we have not
set the browser. Other thing to consider is autoreloading. And well, like
vim, newsboat has colorschemes in:</p>
<p><code>/usr/share/doc/newsboat/contrib</code></p>
<p>To enable them, copy the colorscheme config and include it. Also, to make
links into sections, you can add &ldquo;dummy&rdquo; urls.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># $HOME/.newsboat/config
browser &#34;firefox %u&#34; # $u means url.
auto-reload yes
include inkpot
max-items 15
</code></pre>

<h2 id="making-newsboat-vim-like" class="anchor-link"><a href="#making-newsboat-vim-like">Making newsboat vim-like<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>The graceful feature of open-source applications, extensibility. You can
change keybindings to whatever you want:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>bind-key j down
bind-key k up
bind-key l open
bind-key h quit
bind-key j next articlelist
bind-key k prev articlelist
bind-key J next-feed articlelist
bind-key K prev-feed articlelist
bind-key G end
bind-key g home
bind-key d pagedown
bind-key u pageup
</code></pre>
<h2 id="final-thoughts" class="anchor-link"><a href="#final-thoughts">Final thoughts<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>Once you get it going, it is pretty easy and very convenient to use.
Peruse newsboat docs for every other feature you might want to implement.</p>
