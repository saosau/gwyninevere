        <p>Once I had some time to spare, I decided to spend it on hacking the
computers in our school laboratories. While happiness would take over
me after I succesfully connected my laptop to eduroam via
<code>wpa_supplicant</code> , I began to consider installing dwm without sudo.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-local-repository" class="anchor-link"><a href="#creating-a-local-repository">Creating a local repository<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>The school computers run Debian, so it was hella long since I have used
apt. I would use these commands most frequently:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#8a8a8a;background-color:#1c1c1c;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>apt-cache search [package] <span style="color:#4e4e4e"># search packages</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>apt-get <span style="color:#0087ff">source</span> [package] <span style="color:#4e4e4e"># fetch package source</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>which was pretty nice, because the package versions were compatible with
current Debian release. Source packages usually have a <em>configure script</em>,
with which you can easily set compile flags just like Gentoo USE flags.
To have everything installed in your local repository just add the flag:
<code>--prefix=[directory]</code> .</p>

<h2 id="compiling-source-code" class="anchor-link"><a href="#compiling-source-code">Compiling source code<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>Honestly, it quickly turned into a mundane work, because of dependencies.
<em>dwm</em> depends on X11 libraries, of which I had libXft and libxinerama
missing. libXft depends on libxrender, freetype and fontconfig, moreover
each one of them required either another library or a build time
dependency. Usually pkg-config does the work with CFLAGS/LDFLAGS, but
sometimes I had to go so far to edit pkg-config files themselves. You
usually: 1) include libraries with <code>-I[directory]</code> , 2) link libraries
with <code>-L[directory]</code> . Obviously, I worked this out by writing an <code>lmao.c</code>
file that included local libraries.</p>
<p>I had times where I wanted to give up, but in actuality I just went to WC
to wash my face and continued my suffering. After some time I managed to
get it all going, once I set it up finally dwm appeared. I couldn&rsquo;t
contain it anymore, so I left the room to forget that I have done it. With
thus achieved experience I installed feh as well for my dwm background.
It was an easy run since it was also written in C, with things ready I
found a pretty cool Dark Souls vector wallpaper.</p>

<p>I would say it goes beyond both Arch and Gentoo, once you delve into it,
you start to notice the genius behind these distributions. Well, it works
like a domino: Arch -&gt; Gentoo -&gt; compile it yourself you donkey! Then
there&rsquo;s this thought: &ldquo;How about I get this/that?&rdquo;, but honestly the
school is for study, so watching TV series isn&rsquo;t such a good idea. I
nodded to myself that I will get anki and taskwarrior as well, but the
rest really comes out as unnecessary bloat. I hope my coursemates don&rsquo;t
copycat me and stay with their xfce!</p>
